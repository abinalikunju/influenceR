## Background

InfluenceR is an R package designed to perform influence diagnostics on linear regression models. It calculates and visualizes three key influence measures:

1. Cook's Distance Measure (Cook, 1977)
2. DFFITS (Welsch and Kuh, 1977; Belsley, 1980)
3. Hadi's Influence Measure (Hadi, 1992)

These measures help identify influential observations in regression analysis, which is crucial for understanding the stability and reliability of model estimates.

## Implementation Choices

### Package Structure

The package is structured around a main function `influence_plot()`, which calculates the influence measures and generates a visualization. This design allows for easy use and extension.

### Influence Measures

We chose to implement three influence measures to provide a comprehensive view of potential influential points:

1. Cook's Distance: Measures the effect of deleting a given observation.
2. DFFITS: Measures the change in the predicted value for a point when the point is left out of the regression.
3. Hadi's Influence Measure: A robust measure that is less affected by masking effects.

### Visualization

We use ggplot2 for visualization, creating a faceted plot that allows easy comparison between different influence measures.

## Rationale

1. **Flexibility**: The package allows users to choose which influence measures to calculate and visualize.
2. **Error Handling**: Robust error checking is implemented to handle common issues like NA values, infinite values, and mismatched dimensions.
3. **Performance**: Calculations are optimized for speed, especially for larger datasets.
4. **Extensibility**: The modular design allows for easy addition of new influence measures in the future.
